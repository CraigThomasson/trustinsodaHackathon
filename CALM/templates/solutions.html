                      represent many functions, receive information about the organization at all levels and
                      ranks, and synthesize that information into new ways of working.

                  Accelerate explains that "history has demonstrated that it is possible to find many change agents … but only if people are given a choice, and feel they truly have permission to step
                  forward and act." You must build excitement around the Big Opportunity and develop a feeling that one ”wants to" (vs. ”has to") contribute.
